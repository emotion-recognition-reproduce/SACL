# SACL
The official repository for ACL 2023 paper "[Supervised Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Emotion Recognition in Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01505.pdf)".
This paper proposes a supervised adversarial contrastive learning (SACL) framework for learning class-spread structured representations in a supervised manner, and demonstrate the effectiveness of SACL in context-dependent classification scenarios (i.e., ERC). 

Additionally, the effectiveness of SACL in context-free classification scenarios (i.e., LSA) is demonstrated in its sister work, "[UCAS-IIE-NLP at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Enhancing Generalization of Multilingual BERT for Low-resource Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01093.pdf)", which will be presented at SemEval@ACL 2023.


The code will be released soon.
